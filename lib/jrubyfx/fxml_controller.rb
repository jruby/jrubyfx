  # Event Handlers
  ##

  ##
  # call-seq:
  #   on(callback) { |event_info| block } => Method
  #   on(callback, EventType) { |event_info| block } => Method
  #   on_type(callback) { |event_info| block } => Method
  #
  # Registers a function of name `name` for a FXML defined event with the body in the block
  # Note: there are overrides for most of the default types, so you should never
  # need to manually specify the `type` argument unless you have custom events.
  # The overrides are in the format on_* where * is the event type (ex: on_key for KeyEvent).
  #
  # === Convienence Methods
  # * on_key           is for KeyEvent
  # * on_mouse         is for MouseEvent
  # * on_touch         is for TouchEvent
  # * on_gesture       is for GestureEvent
  # * on_context       is for ContextMenuEvent
  # * on_context_menu  is for ContextMenuEvent
  # * on_drag          is for DragEvent
  # * on_ime           is for InputMethodEvent
  # * on_input_method  is for InputMethodEvent
  # * on_window        is for WindowEvent
  # * on_action        is for ActionEvent
  # * on_generic       is for Event
  #
  # === Examples
  #   on :click do

  #
  #   on_key :keypress do
  #     puts "Key Pressed"

  #
  #   @FXML
  #   private void moved(MouseEvent event) {
  #     System.out.println("Mouse Moved");
