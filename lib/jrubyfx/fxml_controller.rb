  #   fx_handler(callback) { |event_info| block } => Method
  #   fx_handler(callback, EventType) { |event_info| block } => Method
  #   fx_type_handler(callback) { |event_info| block } => Method
  # 
  # Registers a function of name `name` for a FXML defined event with the body in the block
  # Note: there are overrides for most of the default types, so you should never
  # need to manually specify the `type` argument unless you have custom events.
  # The overrides are in the format fx_*_handler where * is the event type (ex:
  # fx_key_handler for KeyEvent).
  # === Overloads
  # * fx_key_handler is for KeyEvent
  # * fx_mouse_handler is for MouseEvent
  # * fx_touch_handler is for TouchEvent
  # * fx_gesture_handler is for GestureEvent
  # * fx_context_handler is for ContextMenuEvent
  # * fx_context_menu_handler is for ContextMenuEvent
  # * fx_drag_handler is for DragEvent
  # * fx_ime_handler is for InputMethodEvent
  # * fx_input_method_handler is for InputMethodEvent
  # * fx_window_handler is for WindowEvent
  # * fx_action_handler is for ActionEvent
  # * fx_generic_handler is for Event
  # 
  # === Examples
  #   fx_handler :click do
  #     puts "button clicked"

  #   fx_key_handler :keypress do
  #     puts "Key Pressed"

  # === Equivalent Java
  #   @FXML
  #   private void click(ActionEvent event) {
  #     System.out.println("button clicked");

  #   @FXML
  #   private void moved(MouseEvent event) {
  #     System.out.println("Mouse Moved");
